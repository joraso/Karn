This repository is intended to be a collection of various machine learning model and deep neural network implementations, as well my experiements with them. This serves as a notebook for me as I teach myself the basics of artificial intellegence, as well as a resource for rapidly deploying similar models in the future.


## Currently included tools:
### Building Blocks
Compound-layer block object used to construct neural networks.
- **DenseBlock**: Simple block of dense layers.
### Network Archetectures
Sample constructions of different neural network archetechtures.
- **SimpleClassifier**: Simple DNN for supervised classification.
- **SimpleAutoEncoder**: Simplest possible autoencoder archetecture

## Notebooks / Experiments:
- **SimpleClassifier_MINSTfashion**: A simple network to classify images of articles of clothing from the MINST fashion data set.
- **SimpleAutoEncoder_MINSTfashion**: A test of autoencoder archetecture on the MINST fashion data set, testing it's reducibility to 2 dimensions.

## Planned subjects to cover are:
- Convulutional networks (image recognition)
- Variational Autoencoders
- Support vector machines / classic ML methods
- Unsupervised / Deep Learning models
