This repository is intended to be a collection of various machine learning model and deep neural network implementations, as well my experiements with them. This serves as a notebook for me as I teach myself the basics of artificial intellegence, as well as a resource for rapidly deploying similar models in the future.


## Currently included is:
- Classification DNN
- Simple AutoEncoder DNN

## Planned inclusions are:
- Variational & convolutional Autoencoders
- Support vector machines / classic ML methods
- Unsupervised / Deep Learning models
